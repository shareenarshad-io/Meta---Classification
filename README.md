# Meta---Classification
Completing classification tasks on data 

Assignment
In this project, you are given large datasets from Rotten Tomatoes - a popular online review aggregator for film and television. Your task is to build a high performing classification algorithm to predict whether a particular movie on Rotten Tomatoes is labeled as 'Rotten', 'Fresh', or 'Certified-Fresh'.

Define, train and evaluate a predictive model that takes as the input the data provided. You may want to split the data into training, testing and validation sets, according to your discretion. Do not use external data for this project. You may use any algorithm of your choice or compare multiple models.

Make sure that the solution reflects your entire thought process - it is more important how the code is structured rather than the final metrics. You are expected to spend no more than 3 hours working on this project.

This project aims to complete the above task.
